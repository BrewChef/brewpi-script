# This script checks whether the python script is running. If it is not running, it starts the script.
# A dontrun file is written if the script is stopped manually, so CRON will not restart it.
# When the Raspberry Pi has lost it's serial port, it will restart the pi. But only after more then 10 minutes after booting.
# To disable this file, remove from the brewpi user's crontab or create the do_not_run_brewpi file: touch /var/www/do_not_run_brewpi
